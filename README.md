# Room Climate Datasets

[UNDER CONSTRUCTION]

## Experimental Setup

We collected room climate data at three different locations under controlled conditions. The locations are denoted as A, B, and C. 

The floor plan of each location can found in this repository.

For more details, please see our publication.

## Format of Data

Each measurement file contains a series of subsequential room climate measurements. 

Each measurement consists of following information:

* Entry ID
* Absolute timestamp [ms]
* Relative timestamp [s]
* Node ID
* Temperature [Â°C]
* Relative Humidity [%]
* Light Sensor 1 (Wavelength) [nm]
* Light Sensor 2 (Wavelength) [nm]
* Number of occupants (0, 1, 2)
* Activity of occupant(s) (0 = n/a, 1 = read, 2 = stand, 3 = walk, 4 = work)
* State of Door (0 = closed, 1 = open)
* State of Window (0 = closed, 1 = open)

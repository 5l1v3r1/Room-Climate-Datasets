# Room Climate Datasets

[UNDER CONSTRUCTION]

Room climate data, i.e., temperature and relative humidity, is supected to leak privacy-sensitive information, e.g., the number of occupants or the activity of the occupants. We evaluated this privacy threat by running a study in which we measured room climate while a occupant performed a pre-defined series of tasks.

To encourage further research on these issues, we provide our collected sensor data (with groundtruth) as open data sets.

## Experimental Setup

We collected room climate data at three different locations in form of controlled experiments. The locations are denoted as A, B, and C. 

The floor plan of each location can found in this repository.

For more details, please see our publication [1].

## Format of Data

Each measurement file contains a series of subsequential room climate measurements. 

Each measurement consists of following information:

* Entry ID
* Absolute timestamp [ms]
* Relative timestamp [s]
* Node ID
* Temperature [Â°C]
* Relative Humidity [%]
* Light Sensor 1 (Wavelength) [nm]
* Light Sensor 2 (Wavelength) [nm]
* Number of occupants (0, 1, 2)
* Activity of occupant(s) (0 = n/a, 1 = read, 2 = stand, 3 = walk, 4 = work)
* State of Door (0 = closed, 1 = open)
* State of Window (0 = closed, 1 = open)
